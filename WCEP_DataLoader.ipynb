According to initial police reports, the explosion took place close to two police vehicles near Gate 2 of Data Darbar. The nature and exact target of the explosion is yet to be ascertained. Rescue operations are underway. The blast comes as the country marks the fasting month of Ramzan.\\n\\nData Darbar, located in Pakistan’s Lahore city, is one of the oldest Sufi shrines in South Asia. Considered to be one of the most sacred places in Lahore, the shrine houses the remains of Sufi saint Abul Hassan Ali Hujwiri, commonly known as Data Ganj Baksh. He is said to have lived on the site in the 11th century and was reputed to have miraculous powers.\\n\\nData Darbar attracts a lot of visitors to its annual Urs festival. The Urs marks the death anniversary of the Sufi saint.\\n\\nAccording to the BBC, the shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. It was later expanded in the 13th century to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri after his spiritual powers became popular.\\n\\nFor centuries, the shrine has seen visitors from all religions. Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is also a frequent visitor to the shrine.\\n\\nIn 2010, two suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests outside the shrine, killing close to 50 people. More than 200 people were injured in the blasts',\n",

              "  'text': \"LAHORE: In a bid to dent the unflinching resolve of thousands of devotees, who have been paying homage resiliently on daily basis for over 900 years at the shrine of Hazrat Abu-ul-Hassan Ali bin Usman Al-Hajveri, reverentially known as Data Gunj Bukhsh, ruthless militant actors attacked the globally-respected saint’s tomb once again in Lahore on Wednesday at will and with absolute ease, killing eight to 10 people, besides injuring scores of humans.\\n\\nThe attack hence makes it absolutely clear that despite continuing counter-terrorism operations launched by the State, the unharnessed and unbridled extremist groups still remain a potent threat to national security.\\n\\nIn July 2010, almost nine years ago, the shrine of Hazrat Data Gunj Bukhsh was attacked by two suicide bombers, seemingly following an imported linear version of the faith.\\n\\nAt least 50 devotees were killed and dozens others injured in the 2010 attack on this 11th Century holy site.\\n\\nThe impact of the two blasts had ripped open the courtyard of the shrine of one of the most important mystic figures and influential preachers to have spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent.\\n\\nResearch shows that not fewer than three dozen shrines across the country have been attacked by the merchants of hatred during the last one decade, who are hell bent upon imposing varying interpretations of the religion, resulting in deaths of hundreds of innocent devotees and zealots till date.\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2017, according to data compiled by the Center for Islamic Research Collaboration and Learning, over 200 people were killed and almost 600 plus injured in 29 terrorist attacks targeting shrines devoted to Sufi saints in Pakistan.\\n\\nSufism, as we all know, is a mystical branch of Islam which spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and has an illustrious history, evolving over 1,000 years.\\n\\nFrom one-room tombs in small villages to large complexes in major cities, Sufi shrines are visited by millions of people every year.\\n\\nBrief chronology and timeline of attacks on Sufi shrines in Pakistan during the last 14 years or so:\\n\\nResearch conducted by the “Jang Group and Geo Television Network” reveals that the first reported attack on a shrine at least dates back to March 19, 2005, when 46 people were killed in an act of terror on the tomb of Pir Syed Rakhel Shah at Fatehpur, a small town in the Jhal Magsi district of Balochistan.\\n\\nIn May 27, 2005, around two dozen people had perished and nearly 100 others were left reeling with injuries after a powerful explosion had hit the Bari Imam shrine at Noorpur Shahan village in Islamabad.\\n\\nSecurity guards and witnesses said that some 8,000 to 10,000 followers were attending a Majlis at this shrine, when a bearded man of medium height and dark complexion had walked up to the stage to blow himself up.\\n\\nA press note issued by the local District Magistrate had said: “When a Majlis-i-Aza was being held in the compound of Hazrat Bari Imam (RA) shrine, an unknown person suddenly entered the premises of the shrine and attempted to embrace the speaker. Soon after the occurrence, the mob present at the shrine got infuriated and started pelting the police officials on duty with stones.”\\n\\nOn December 18, 2007, militants had blown up the shrine of Abdul Shakoor Malang Baba on the Grand Trunk Road.\\n\\nIn March 2008, an attack on the 400-year-old shrine of Hazrat Abu Saeed Baba on the outskirts of Peshawar had killed 10 villagers.\\n\\nThe March 5, 2009 attack on the shrine of Rehman Baba, a revered Pashto Sufi poet of the 17th century, was widely condemned in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\n\\nAlthough the bombing of Rehman Baba’s shrine near Peshawar did not result in any casualty, it had left an indelible mark on the sanctity of his shrine. A day after the attack on Rehman Baba’s shrine, the shrine of Bahadur Baba was targeted by missiles.\\n\\nSince the Rehman Baba shrine attack, numerous Sufi shrines in Hangu, Nowshera and Buner were bombed, burnt or closed down. Simultaneously, attacks mosques claimed casualties running in hundreds.\\n\\nA suicide attack on the shrine of Sufi Saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, in Karachi had killed nine people in October 2010.\\n\\nAn attack on the 12th-century Sufi saint Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar’s shrine in Pakpattan, also occurring in October 2010, had left seven people dead.\\n\\nOn April 3, 2011, some 52 people were killed and 120 wounded when two suicide bombers detonated explosives at the shrine of the 13th-century saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, at Dera Ghazi Khan.\\n\\nOn March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had upheld a life imprisonment sentence awarded by a trial court to a would-be suicide bomber in the Sakhi Sarwar shrine suicide attack case.\\n\\nThe accused, Bahram alias Sufi Baba, was given the death penalty 52 times and awarded life imprisonment 73 times. He was accused of preparing the suicide bomb for the attack.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, however, declared this sentence null and void as the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence.\\n\\nThe second accused, Umar Fidai, had been sentenced to life imprisonment 125 times by a trial court. The appeal against his sentence was dismissed by the country's highest court.\\n\\nThe Chief Justice had asked how one could be sentenced for life 125 times in one lifetime. He ordered the running of all sentences simultaneously. The shrines of Sufi saints Sheikh Nisa Baba and Sheikh Bahadur Baba in Khyber Agency were attacked on December 11, 2012.\\n\\nOn February 25, 2013, the shrine of Ghulam Shah Ghazi, in Marri village near Shikarpur, was attacked, killing four people on the scene and wounding more than 27 others.\\n\\nAmong the dead was Pir Syed Hajan Shah – a spiritual leader. He had died on March 4. After the news of Shah’s death spread; markets, businesses and trade centres across Sindh were closed down voluntarily on March 5 to honour him. It is imperative to note that just five days earlier on February 20, 2013, militants had attacked the convoy of another Sindhi spiritual leader, Syed Hussain Shah (popularly known as Saeen Hussain Shah Qambar), with a remote-controlled bomb in the Ahmed Deen Brohi area of Jacobabad District. He had escaped unharmed, but the bomb killed his grandson Shafiq Shafi Shah and injured eight others.\\n\\nOn November 12, 2016, over 50 devotees at the remote shrine of Shah Noorani in Khuzdar, Balochistan, were massacred. Several people were killed and injured due to a stampede caused by the blast and scores of injured were transported to hospital in private vehicles by visitors who survived the attack.\\n\\nIn October 2017, a suicide bomber had again targeted the shrine of Sufi saint, Pir Rakhel Shah, at Jhal Magsi in Balochistan after a gap of 12 years, killing around 20 people on the spot.\\n\\nOn February 17, 2017, a suicide bomber had struck the devotees at the gold-domed mausoleum of revered Sufi saint Syed Usman Marwandi, also known as the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, at Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, resulting in at least 83 deaths within hours of the attack.\\n\\nA series of attacks over the last five days in February 2017 had hit all four of Pakistan’s provinces and two major cities, killing nearly 100 people.\\n\\nThe “Reuters” had reported: “The shrine is one of Pakistan’s most revered holy sites and attracts up to a million visitors each year. It is perhaps best known for men and women practicing the ancient form of Sufi dance called the ‘dhamaal’.”\\n\\nHazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar’s shrine was built in 1356 and is decorated with Sindhi ‘kashi-tiles’ classic mirror-work and a fabulous gold-plated door donated by Iran’s Emperor Reza Shah Pahlavi. This door was installed by the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\\n\\nLal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177-1275), called Lal (red) for donning a red attire throughout his life, had not only preached peace and love throughout his stay on the planet along with his contemporaries like Bahauddin Zakariya, Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar and Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari but is also globally respected for being a symbol of pluralism, inter-faith harmony and collective aesthetics.\",\n",

A day after the attack on Rehman Baba’s shrine, the shrine of Bahadur Baba was targeted by missiles.\\n\\nSince the Rehman Baba shrine attack, numerous Sufi shrines in Hangu, Nowshera and Buner were bombed, burnt or closed down. Simultaneously, attacks mosques claimed casualties running in hundreds.\\n\\nA suicide attack on the shrine of Sufi Saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, in Karachi had killed nine people in October 2010.\\n\\nAn attack on the 12th-century Sufi saint Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar’s shrine in Pakpattan, also occurring in October 2010, had left seven people dead.\\n\\nOn April 3, 2011, some 52 people were killed and 120 wounded when two suicide bombers detonated explosives at the shrine of the 13th-century saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, at Dera Ghazi Khan.\\n\\nOn March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had upheld a life imprisonment sentence awarded by a trial court to a would-be suicide bomber in the Sakhi Sarwar shrine suicide attack case.\\n\\nThe accused, Bahram alias Sufi Baba, was given the death penalty 52 times and awarded life imprisonment 73 times. He was accused of preparing the suicide bomb for the attack.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, however, declared this sentence null and void as the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence.\\n\\nThe second accused, Umar Fidai, had been sentenced to life imprisonment 125 times by a trial court. The appeal against his sentence was dismissed by the country's highest court.\\n\\nThe Chief Justice had asked how one could be sentenced for life 125 times in one lifetime. He ordered the running of all sentences simultaneously.\\n\\nThe shrines of Sufi saints Sheikh Nisa Baba and Sheikh Bahadur Baba in Khyber Agency were attacked on December 11, 2012.\\n\\nOn February 25, 2013, the shrine of Ghulam Shah Ghazi, in Marri village near Shikarpur, was attacked, killing four people on the scene and wounding more than 27 others.\\n\\nAmong the dead was Pir Syed Hajan Shah – a spiritual leader. He had died on March 4. After the news of Shah’s death spread; markets, businesses and trade centres across Sindh were closed down voluntarily on March 5 to honour him.\\n\\nIt is imperative to note that just five days earlier on February 20, 2013, militants had attacked the convoy of another Sindhi spiritual leader, Syed Hussain Shah (popularly known as Saeen Hussain Shah Qambar), with a remote-controlled bomb in the Ahmed Deen Brohi area of Jacobabad District. He had escaped unharmed, but the bomb killed his grandson Shafiq Shafi Shah and injured eight others.\\n\\nOn November 12, 2016, over 50 devotees at the remote shrine of Shah Noorani in Khuzdar, Balochistan, were massacred. Several people were killed and injured due to a stampede caused by the blast and scores of injured were transported to hospital in private vehicles by visitors who survived the attack.\\n\\nIn October 2017, a suicide bomber had again targeted the shrine of Sufi saint, Pir Rakhel Shah, at Jhal Magsi in Balochistan after a gap of 12 years, killing around 20 people on the spot.\\n\\nOn February 17, 2017, a suicide bomber had struck the devotees at the gold-domed mausoleum of revered Sufi saint Syed Usman Marwandi, also known as the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, at Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, resulting in at least 83 deaths within hours of the attack.\\n\\nA series of attacks over the last five days in February 2017 had hit all four of Pakistan’s provinces and two major cities, killing nearly 100 people.\\n\\nThe “Reuters” had reported: “The shrine is one of Pakistan’s most revered holy sites and attracts up to a million visitors each year. It is perhaps best known for men and women practicing the ancient form of Sufi dance called the ‘dhamaal’.”\\n\\nHazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar’s shrine was built in 1356 and is decorated with Sindhi ‘kashi-tiles’ classic mirror-work and a fabulous gold-plated door donated by Iran’s Emperor Reza Shah Pahlavi. This door was installed by the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\\n\\nLal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177-1275), called Lal (red) for donning a red attire throughout his life, had not only preached peace and love throughout his stay on the planet along with his contemporaries like Bahauddin Zakariya, Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar and Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari but is also globally respected for being a symbol of pluralism, inter-faith harmony and collective aesthetics.\",\n",

              "  'text': 'LAHORE: At least 10 people including four Elite Force personnel were martyred and 28 others injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside Data Darbar on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe blast occurred near a mobile van of the Elite Force parked near Gate Number 2, around 200 to 300 meters away from the actual entrance to the shrine at 8:44am. The injured were shifted to the Mayo Hospital, confirmed Rescue 1122 officials. Forensic experts collected evidence from the blast site and emergency was declared in hospitals of the provincial metropolis following the blast. The experts also collected the remains of the suicide bomber. The age of the bomber apparently ranged from eighteen to twenty, the police believed. He appeared from Sheesh Mahal Road on foot, approached the Elite Force personnel carrier and detonated his explosives near the vehicle. The police cordoned off the area soon after the attack and started investigations.\\n\\nThe martyred police officials are Head Constable Muhammad Suhail, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Gulzar Ali and Constable Muhammad Saleem The martyred citizens include private security guard Rafaqat, Rafique and four unknown persons including a 12-year-old child. Funeral prayers for the four police officials were offered at District Police Lines. Governor Chaudhry Sarwar, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, provincial ministers, Inspector General of Police Cap (R) Arif Nawaz, CCPO Lahore BA Nasir and other civil and military high-ranking officers attended the prayers.\\n\\nSuhail hailed from Gujranwala, Shahid from Kasur and Saleem from Mustafabad, Lahore. The injured constables were identified as Sadam Hussain, Muhammad Ejaz and Muhammad Kamran. The injured citizens were identified as Lubna Idrees, 35, Nawaz (cop), Ejazul Haq (cop), 22, Muhammad Ramzan (cop), Kamran (cop), 25, Muhammad Yousaf, 60, Ghulam Farid, 23, Syed Dildar Hussain, 38, Aurengzeb, Abdul Raheem, 50, Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, 60, Sarwar Khan, 45, Shabbir, 45, Faisal, 18, Allah Ditta, 12, Faryad, 50, Muhammad Asif, 65, Waqas, Ansar, 28 and Feezan, 19.\\n\\nThe police collected the CCTV footage from the Punjab Safe Cities Authority to identify the blast handlers. The Metro Bus Service was suspended from the MAO College to Data Darbar. Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar cancelled his trip to Bhakkar and summoned the officers of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority. He asked the IGP Punjab to submit a report on the incident.\\n\\nPrime Minister Imran Khan condemned the blast and sought a report. The premier condoled with the bereaved families and directed the authorities concerned to provide best possible medical treatment to those injured in the blast.\\n\\nThe IGP visited Data Darbar after the blast and condemned the terror attack. He also monitored rescue and relief activities. He said the suicide attack was a cowardly act of anti-social elements, which could not shake the commitment of brave officials to protect the lives and properties of the public. He directed all RPOs and DPOs to visit field during Taraveeh prayers to check the security of “A” category at mosques. He directed that on highways, a sniper should be deputed at a distance from check-posts to handle any untoward incident. He said that senior officers should brief officials on security duty about the sensitivity of their duty on a daily basis to get best results. He directed beefing up security at sensitive mosques, Imambargahs and business centres. Search, sweep, combing and intelligence-based operations should be geared up to improve security at entry and exit points of the city. He said the Punjab Police are acting as front line soldiers in the war against terrorism and sacrifices of police officials for peace in the country will not go waste. The DIG Operations also visited the crime scene and gave instructions to the officers with regard to strengthening the security across the city.\\n\\nCTD investigators have collected one hand of the suicide bomber and dispatched it to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for identification. The CTD registered FIR No 11/19 under Sections 302/324186/353, 427/34120-B/109 of PPC, ¾ of Explosive Substance Act and 7 ATA. The complainant has said that three terrorists including the suicide bomber had approached the Elite Force vehicle from the Minar-e-Pakistan side. Two handlers left the place by shaking hands with the bomber and disappeared in the adjoining locality. The blast was so powerful that buildings were jolted while windowpanes shattered. The incident created panic in the locality.\\n\\nThe CCTV footage shows that the suicide bomber wearing Shalwar Kameez and waistcoat approached the Elite Force mobile and exploded himself with a big bang. It could be clearly seen in the footage that he was holding the trigger of the detonator in hand and was quickly moving forward towards the police personnel carrier. However, the officials of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority deputed for monitoring suspicious activities could not spot him that helped him achieve his target.\\n\\nIt is worth-mentioning here that the Hizb-ul-Ahrar, a faction of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack in a message disseminated on the social media. The CTD and other law-enforcement agencies are trying to authenticate the claim. The spokesperson of the terrorist organization has termed the blast an Ishtihadi (suicidal) attack. It claimed targeting 12 personnel of law-enforcement agencies including cops and officials of sensitive agencies. The spokesman also claimed that there was no public at the time of the attack. In fact, a number of visitors fell victim to the blast and received injuries. The coward terrorist organization has threatened to carry further attacks on big targets.\\n\\nCCPO Lahore BA Nasir visited the Mayo Hospital twice to inquire after the injured and presented the injured policemen with bouquets and cash amount of Rs 50,000 each.\\n\\nThree persons from Multan were killed in the blast and all of them belonged to the same village, the police said. The residents of Basti Jhandeywali on the Multan-Vehari road, Muhammad Rafiq, his eight years old son Ahmed and cousin Mushtaq Ahmed had gone to Data Darbar for pilgrimage, said Punjab Energy Minister Dr Akhtar Malik.\\n\\nChief Minister Usman Buzdar has directed the authorities concerned to trace the network responsible for the blast at Data Darbar as soon as possible. He gave these directions while chairing a meeting at the Punjab Safe Cities Authority head office to review the law and order situation after the blast.\\n\\nThe inspector general of police, Punjab, presented the initial report regarding the incident to the CM. The CM was also apprised of the progress made in investigations. “We pay tributes to the sacrifices of martyrs and their heirs will not be left alone. We share the grief with them,” he said.\\n\\nProvincial Ministers Basharat Raja, Hashim Dogar, Taimoor Khan and the chief secretary were present.\\n\\nSpecial Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan condemned the blast. In a statement, she expressed condolences with the families of the martyres and said that those targeting the shrines of Sufi saints are enemies of Pakistan, who want to create anarchy in the country through hatching conspiracies.',\n",

              "  'text': 'We are forced to wonder when the trail of death and misery, motivated by misguided ideological belief, will end in our country. The claims it had been ended were shattered on Wednesday morning in Lahore when a suicide bomber detonated his vest next to a vehicle carrying members of the Elite police force in the immediate proximity of the Data Darbar shrine in Lahore. The shrine is a major site of Sufi Islam in the country, visited by millions each year. Since 2010, when blasts inside the complex killed scores, there has been heavy security thrown around the mausoleum and it appears these security forces were targeted in the latest attack. At least ten people are reported to be killed, including three security personnel. We cannot say if the selection of the location for the bombing was intended to send out a message in itself. Orthodox religious forces, including those engaged in militancy, have traditionally opposed Sufi Islamic beliefs and there has been some squabbling between sects over this. According to some reports in the media, a Taliban splinter faction claimed responsibility for the attack.\\n\\nWhat we do know in certainty is that more lives have been needlessly lost. After a considerable period of time, a major terrorist attack has taken place in the city of Lahore. This in itself suggests that militants are able to operate everywhere and anywhere they choose in the country, without hindrance. The omens are not good in this respect. It is obviously impossible for security personnel to control or cordon off every alley and every square in a major city, with the Data Darbar shrine located in a particularly congested and heavily used area. The focus then has to be to find the places from where these groups operate, to capture their leaders and to dismantle their organisations. Yes, significant groups who had carried out attacks in the past have been weakened. But it seems killers can still unleash mayhem in our midst.\\n\\nThe message that goes out to the world and to the citizens of Pakistan itself, just as the holy month of Ramazan begins, is not a positive one. It suggests we are still held hostage to militants who use religion for their own purposes. They have not spared a shrine which brings together tens of thousands of believers even during a month that is sacred to Muslims everywhere. This should alert us to the fact that the people who kill are not true believers. Their purposes are different and they are dangerous. They have already created chaos across the country and divided it increasingly along lines of sect, belief, ethnicity, and ideology. It now seems they are bent on inflicting further damage.',\n",

              "  'text': 'We are forced to wonder when the trail of death and misery, motivated by misguided ideological belief, will end in our country. The claims it had been ended were shattered on Wednesday morning in Lahore when a suicide bomber detonated his vest next to a vehicle carrying members of the Elite police force in the immediate proximity of the Data Darbar shrine in Lahore. The shrine is a major site of Sufi Islam in the country, visited by millions each year. Since 2010, when blasts inside the complex killed scores, there has been heavy security thrown around the mausoleum and it appears these security forces were targeted in the latest attack. At least ten people are reported to be killed, including three security personnel. We cannot say if the selection of the location for the bombing was intended to send out a message in itself. Orthodox religious forces, including those engaged in militancy, have traditionally opposed Sufi Islamic beliefs and there has been some squabbling between sects over this. According to some reports in the media, a Taliban splinter faction claimed responsibility for the attack.\\n\\nWhat we do know in certainty is that more lives have been needlessly lost. After a considerable period of time, a major terrorist attack has taken place in the city of Lahore. This in itself suggests that militants are able to operate everywhere and anywhere they choose in the country, without hindrance. The omens are not good in this respect. It is obviously impossible for security personnel to control or cordon off every alley and every square in a major city, with the Data Darbar shrine located in a particularly congested and heavily used area. The focus then has to be to find the places from where these groups operate, to capture their leaders and to dismantle their organisations. Yes, significant groups who had carried out attacks in the past have been weakened. But it seems killers can still unleash mayhem in our midst.\\n\\nThe message that goes out to the world and to the citizens of Pakistan itself, just as the holy month of Ramazan begins, is not a positive one. It suggests we are still held hostage to militants who use religion for their own purposes. They have not spared a shrine which brings together tens of thousands of believers even during a month that is sacred to Muslims everywhere. This should alert us to the fact that the people who kill are not true believers. Their purposes are different and they are dangerous. They have already created chaos across the country and divided it increasingly along lines of sect, belief, ethnicity, and ideology. It now seems they are bent on inflicting further damage.',\n",
